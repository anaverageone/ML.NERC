### Files
Current zip file holds following files for feature extraction, classification experiment, hyper-parameter tuing, feature ablation, and final system validation:

- ```NER_Preprocess.ipynb```: a jupiter notebook to pre-process original training (conll2003.train.conll), devlopment (conll2003.dev.conll), and test (conll2003.test.conll). Output is used in ```Experiment.ipynb``` for training the classifiers and validating (testing) the system.


- ```Experiment.ipynb```: a jupiter notebook containing all functions for feature extraction, classification experiment, hyper-parameter tuing, feature ablation, and final system validation.


- ```word_embedding_basic_system.ipynb```: a jupiter notebook to incoporate word embeddings and one-hot encoding as feature representation for system experiment.
